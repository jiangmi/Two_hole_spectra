This program deals with two holes moving around in a periodic lattice of CuO2 unit cells. The variational space is constructed and then the Hamiltonian matrix is generated and diagonalized with Lanczos.

Each unit cell consists of 5 d-orbitals and both px,py orbitals for other two sites

Two holes both can be up or dn.
